## 🎯 Overview

This application predicts fraudulent transactions in online payment systems using advanced machine learning techniques. Designed for real-time fraud detection and prevention, it empowers financial institutions and e-commerce platforms to identify suspicious activities instantly.

### Key Objectives
- ✅ Enhance user trust and platform credibility
- 💸 Reduce financial losses
- 🛡️ Comply with regulatory security standards

## ✨ Features

### 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection
- Detects fraud during transaction processing by analyzing transaction features like amount, origin, and time
- Provides immediate feedback to help prevent fraudulent activities

### 2. Interactive Interface
- Powered by Streamlit, users can easily input transaction details to get predictions
- Designed for accessibility and user-friendliness, ensuring a seamless experience

### 3. Comprehensive Feature Engineering
- Implements advanced preprocessing steps to clean and optimize transaction data
- Handles missing values, scaling amounts, and encoding categorical variables

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with interactive visualizations
- Outlier detection and removal using Z-Score and IQR methods
- Correlation analysis and feature importance visualization

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fraud-detection-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📖 Usage

### Single Transaction Analysis
1. Navigate to the "Getting Started" section
2. Enter transaction details:
   - **Step**: Time step of the transaction
   - **Amount**: Transaction amount
   - **Old Balance (Origin)**: Original balance in the origin account
   - **New Balance (Origin)**: New balance in the origin account after transaction
   - **Old Balance (Destination)**: Original balance in the destination account
   - **New Balance (Destination)**: New balance in the destination account after transaction
   - **Is Flagged as Fraud**: Whether the transaction was internally flagged (0/1)

3. Click "Detect Fraud and View Results" to get predictions

### Bulk Transaction Analysis
1. Prepare a CSV file with the required columns:
   - `step`, `amount`, `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`, `isFlaggedFraud`
2. Upload the file through the bulk analysis interface
3. View comprehensive results and download analysis reports

### Sample Data
The project includes sample CSV files:
- `sample_bulk_transactions.csv`: Example transactions for testing
- `obvious_fraud_transactions.csv`: Known fraudulent transactions for validation

## 🤖 Model Details

### Random Forest Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest (Ensemble of Decision Trees)
- **Library**: scikit-learn's `RandomForestClassifier`
- **AUC-ROC Score**: 0.9556
- **Accuracy**: ~96% on test set
- **Precision**: ~49% for fraud detection
- **F1-Score**: ~65%

### Features Used
- `step`: Time step of the transaction
- `amount`: Transaction amount
- `oldbalanceOrg`: Original balance in the origin account before the transaction
- `newbalanceOrig`: New balance in the origin account after the transaction
- `oldbalanceDest`: Original balance in the destination account before the transaction
- `newbalanceDest`: New balance in the destination account after the transaction
- `isFlaggedFraud`: Indicates whether the transaction was internally flagged as potentially fraudulent

### Hyperparameters
- `n_estimators`: 45 (number of trees in the forest)
- `max_depth`: 4 (maximum depth of each tree)
- `min_samples_split`: 100 (minimum samples required to split a node)
- `min_samples_leaf`: 30 (minimum samples required at a leaf node)
- `random_state`: 42 (for reproducibility)

## 📊 Data Visualization

The application includes comprehensive visualizations:

### Data Exploration
- Transaction Types distribution
- Fraud vs. Flagged Fraud analysis
- Percentage of Fraud by Hour
- KDE Plot of Amount by Class

### Outlier Analysis
